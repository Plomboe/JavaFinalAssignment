# JavaFinalAssignment
This is our final project for COMP___.
It is using JavaFx, and an Oracle SQL Server as the Database.

If you run into a "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver not found" error, it's because the build path for ojdbc6.jar is pointed to a path to my repository, and not yours. Install ojdbc6.jar onto your machine, and reference the build path.
